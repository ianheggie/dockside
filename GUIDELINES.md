# Dockside Development Philosophy and Technical Guidelines

## Purpose
Personal tool to simplify Dockerizing Ruby projects by pragmatic analysis of:
- System command dependencies
- Package requirements
- Docker best practices

## Design Philosophy
- Clarity over complexity
- Useful, actionable insights
- Minimal, focused implementation
- Solve real problems, not theoretical ones

## Core Principles
- Tests should reveal problems, not just pass/fail
- Each class does ONE thing well
- Keep classes under 200 lines
- Prefer readability and understanding over clever abstractions

## Technical Approach
- Pure Ruby, minimal dependencies
- Practical static analysis
- Actionable recommendations
- Support real-world Ruby project scenarios

## Implementation Guidelines
- Favor explicit over implicit
- Make failure modes informative
- Design for human comprehension
- Optimize for understanding, not performance extremes

## Project Focus
- Ruby ecosystem tooling
- Pragmatic Docker configuration
- Developer productivity
